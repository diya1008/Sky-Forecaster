## NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 Submission

**Project Name:** Sky Forecaster  
**Challenge:** From EarthData to Action: Cloud Computing with Earth Observation Data for Predicting Cleaner, Safer Skies  
**Team:** Mambacita  
**Event:** Nirma University
---

## High-Level Project Summary

Sky Forecaster is a data-driven web application that addresses the critical challenge of air quality prediction and monitoring using NASA Earth observation data. Our project harnesses cloud computing to process satellite data and ground-based measurements, providing real-time air quality forecasts to help communities make informed decisions about outdoor activities and health safety.

**What we developed:** A comprehensive air quality monitoring and forecasting platform that integrates NASA TEMPO satellite data, OpenAQ ground measurements, and meteorological data to predict air quality conditions up to 7 days in advance.

**How it addresses the challenge:** By combining NASA Earth observation data with cloud computing capabilities, we provide actionable air quality information that helps communities predict and prepare for poor air quality conditions, contributing to cleaner, safer skies.

**Why it's important:** Air pollution affects billions of people worldwide, causing millions of premature deaths annually. Our solution democratizes access to NASA's satellite data, making advanced air quality predictions available to communities that may not have access to sophisticated monitoring infrastructure.
